# Interface AbsoluteHardwareValueMatcher

Defines a means of recognizing when an absolute value is input by the user (for example, when moving a slider or turning a knob based on some MIDI message). This matcher can then be set on an AbsoluteHardwareControl using AbsoluteHardwareControl.setAdjustValueMatcher(AbsoluteHardwareValueMatcher).
