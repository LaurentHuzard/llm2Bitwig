## 🚀 The Headline
**"From Monolith to Modular: Bitwig POC Grows Up"**

Today's session marked a significant maturity point for the project. We moved beyond simple "it works" proofs into robust, maintainable architecture. We successfully implemented comprehensive Transport Loop controls, added critical Track Management features, and—most importantly—refactored the growing Bitwig Controller script into clean, manageable modules.

## 🛠 What We Built

### 1. Controller Refactoring (The "God Class" Slayer)
The `BitwigPOC.control.js` file was becoming unwieldy. We sliced it into dedicated modules:
- **`modules/Transport.js`**: Handles play, stop, loop, tempo.
- **`modules/TrackBank.js`**: Manages the track bank, clips, scenes, and mixer controls.
- **`modules/Cursor.js`**: Handles the selected track and device remote controls.
- **`modules/Application.js`**: Handles project-level actions (creating tracks).
- **`BitwigPOC.control.js`**: Now acts purely as a content router and connection manager.

### 2. Transport Loop Controls (Feature Set A Complete)
We filled the gaps in transport control. The AI can now:
- Toggle the Arranger Loop.
- Set Loop Start and End points.
- Query the current loop status.

### 3. Track Management (Feature Set B Extensions)
The AI has gained administrative powers over tracks:
- **Rename**: `track_rename(index, name)`
- **Color**: `track_set_color(index, r, g, b)`
- **Duplicate**: `track_duplicate(index)`
- **Delete**: `track_delete(index)`

## 🔍 Technical Highlights

- **Dynamic Module Loading**: Utilizing Bitwig's `load()` function to separate concerns without a build step.
- **Test Coverage**: Created `test_transport_loop.js` and `test_track_management.js` to verify these specific feature sets independently.

## 📊 Status Check

| Feature Set | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A. Transport** | ✅ 100% | Full playback, tempo, and loop control. |
| **B. Track Mgmt** | 🟡 80% | Basic + Mgmt done. Routing/Groups pending. |
| **C. Devices** | 🟡 40% | Remote controls done. Loading/Browsing pending. |
| **D. Mixer** | 🏗️ Started | Vol/Pan/Sends implemented. Needs verification. |
| **E. Clips/Scenes** | 🟡 50% | Launch/Record done. Editing/Arranging pending. |
| **F. Observation** | 🔴 0% | Event system not started. |

## 🔮 Next Steps
1. **Device Mastery**: Implement device loading, deletion, and preset browsing.
2. **Mixer Verification**: Create test scripts to confirm Master and Send controls work as expected.
3. **The "Killer Feature"**: Start designing the Event/Observation system so the AI can "listen" to Bitwig changes in real-time.
