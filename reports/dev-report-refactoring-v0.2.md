# Development Report: The Great Modularization (v0.2)

## 🚀 Milestone: Modular Architecture Achieved

Today marks a significant maturity point for the **Bitwig MCP POC**. The team has successfully transitioned the `BitwigPOC.control.js` controller script from a monolithic structure into a fully modular architecture.

### 🏗 What Changed?
The heavy lifting was done by splitting the `TrackBank.js` module. Previously, this file was doing too much—managing tracks, scenes, clips, AND the master track.

The **Implementer** agent deftly extracted this logic into two new modules:
-   **`SceneBank.js`**: A dedicated home for Scene operations.
-   **`Mixer.js`**: A focused module for Master Track and global mixer controls.

The **Modules Loaded**:
-   `Transport`
-   `TrackBank` (now leaner)
-   `SceneBank` (new!)
-   `Mixer` (new!)
-   `Cursor`
-   `Application`

### 🔧 Technical Highlights
-   **Decoupling**: `TrackBank.js` no longer knows about the Master Track. This separation of concerns allows us to scale mixer features (like returns/groups) without bloating the track logic.
-   **API Consistency**: Despite the major surgery under the hood, the **Tester** confirmed that the external MCP API remains unchanged. The `index.js` server speaks the same language, but the controller handles it with greater elegance.

### 📊 Stats
-   **Files Modified**: 4 (`BitwigPOC.control.js`, `TrackBank.js`, `SceneBank.js`, `Mixer.js`)
-   **New Modules**: 2
-   **Complexity Rating**: Reduced (per file)

### 🗣 Quote of the Day
> "A tidy codebase is a happy codebase. By splitting the concerns now, we pave the way for complex features like the 'LLM Arrangement Builder' without tripping over our own wires." — *The Planner*

### 🔮 What's Next?
With the foundation solid, the road is open for **Phase 2 features**: Note editing? Browser integration? The possibilities are now much easier to implement.
